A Nikto vulnerability assessment was executed from the Attacker VM (Kali Linux – 192.168.20.10) targeting the Admin VM (192.168.10.10), which hosts an HTTP service (Microsoft IIS 10.0) behind the FortiGate firewall.

Command Used
nikto -h http://192.168.10.10

Scan Findings

The target is running Microsoft IIS/10.0

X-Frame-Options header is missing, making the application susceptible to clickjacking attacks

X-Content-Type-Options header is missing, allowing the browser to perform MIME-type sniffing

No CGI directories were identified

Interpretation

The Nikto scan simulated a real-world attacker probing the internal web server for misconfigurations and security weaknesses.
These findings highlight missing security headers while also validating the FortiGate firewall’s capability to inspect, detect, and control HTTP-based attack attempts.

2. FortiGate IPS Logs (Detection & Prevention)

During the Nikto scan, the FortiGate firewall successfully detected and blocked the suspicious HTTP traffic originating from Kali. The activity was logged under Security Events → Intrusion Prevention with a severity rating of Critical.

Key Log Details

Source: 192.168.20.10 (Kali Attacker)

Destination: 192.168.10.10 (Admin Web Server)

Service: HTTP (Port 80)

Action: Dropped

Severity: Critical

Policy Direction: Port3 (Attacker) → Port2 (Admin LAN)

Firewall Response

Identified malicious HTTP probes using signature-based IPS

Immediately blocked all suspicious requests

Prevented potential exploitation of missing or weak security headers

Recorded detailed logs including source, destination, protocol, service, and triggered signatures

Why This Matters

This outcome demonstrates that the FortiGate IPS, firewall policies, and security profiles are properly configured and functioning as intended.
It shows effective real-time mitigation of reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning attempts within the lab environment—reflecting strong network security posture.
