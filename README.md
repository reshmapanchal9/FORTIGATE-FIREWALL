The project is implemented in a virtualized lab environment, where all components—
firewall, virtual machines, and switches—are interconnected using virtual network 
infrastructure. This architecture ensures safe testing, isolation, and full control over traffic 
flow without affecting a physical production network.
The virtual network is designed using three FortiGate physical interfaces, each mapped to 
separate virtual switches:
