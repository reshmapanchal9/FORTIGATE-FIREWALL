FortiGate is an advanced next-generation firewall (NGFW) developed by Fortinet, designed to provide 
unified threat management, secure network segmentation, and deep traffic inspection. It offers a 
combination of security features such as IPS, web filtering, antivirus, application control, and SSL 
inspection, accessible through both GUI and CLI. FortiGate is widely used in enterprise and virtualized 
environments to deliver high-performance network security and centralized visibility, making it ideal for 
multi-VLAN and multi-segment architectures.
This project involves the strategic integration of a FortiGate next-generation firewall within a structured 
virtualized network environment, where three physical firewall interfaces are logically mapped to 
dedicated virtual switches. Port1 is connected to the WAN_ext external switch, serving as the central 
transit network for inter-segment communication. Port2 interfaces with vSwitch_Admin, providing secured 
connectivity for the Admin VM, while Port3 is linked to vSwitch_Attacker, which hosts the Kali Linux 
attacker VM used for security testing. The FortiGate appliance is administered through both its graphical 
user interface (GUI) and command-line interface (CLI), enabling precise configuration of routing, 
segmentation, and security controls essential for maintaining a robust and well-governed network 
architecture.
Throughout the project, interfaces were configured, along with address objects, firewall policies, and 
security profiles. These policies were combined with IPS, web filtering, and application control to ensure 
safe communication between different segments. The firewall rules were designed to allow legitimate 
traffic while monitoring, detecting, and blocking harmful behavior. Each security profile attached to the 
firewall policies enhanced visibility and response capabilities across the network.
To evaluate the firewall’s effectiveness, multiple test attacks were executed from the Kali Linux attacker 
VM toward the Admin VM. These included reconnaissance, exploitation attempts, and malicious file 
transfers. The FortiGate successfully generated detailed logs and security reports, detecting and preventing 
harmful activities while allowing permitted traffic. This demonstrated the firewall’s capability to secure the 
environment by providing comprehensive monitoring, threat prevention, and controlled access between 
network segments
