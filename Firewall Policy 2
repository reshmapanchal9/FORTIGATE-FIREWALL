Policy 2: ATTACKER_TO_ADMIN
Purpose:
Allows the Attacker VM to reach the Admin VM. This is required for:
• Nmap scans
• SQL injection attacks
• Metasploit/MSFVenom tests
• FTP/SSH brute force
Key Configuration:
• Incoming: ATTACKER (port3)
• Outgoing: ADMIN_LAN (port2)
• Source: Attacker-subnet
• Destination: Admin-Subnet
• Service: ALL
• NAT: ON
• Action: ACCEPT
Security Considerations:
This rule should always have:
• IPS enabled
• Application Control enabled
• Antivirus scanning ON (if file transfers occur)
What logs appear?
• IPS alerts (SQLi, SMB exploits, FTP brute force)
• Application Control logs (Nmap, Hydra, browser traffic)
• Traffic logs (TCP SYN floods, port scans)
