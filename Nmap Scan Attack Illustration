To evaluate the effectiveness of the FortiGate security controls, an Nmap-based vulnerability 
scan was launched from the Attacker VM (Kali Linux) targeting the Admin VM 
(192.168.10.10). The objective of this test was to simulate reconnaissance activity typically 
performed by an attacker before exploitation.
Two scans were executed:
1. HTTP Vulnerability Detection Scan
sudo nmap --script http-vuln* 192.168.10.10
This scan attempts to discover known HTTP-based vulnerabilities.
The results revealed several open ports (22, 80, 135, 139, 445, 2000, 5060, 5985), 
demonstrating potential attack surfaces.
2. Aggressive Service & OS Detection with Vulnerability Scripts
sudo nmap -sS -sV -O --script vuln 192.168.10.10
This scan performs:
• SYN Stealth Scan (-sS)
• Service Version Detection (-sV)
• OS Fingerprinting (-O)
• Vulnerability Enumeration (--script vuln)
This represents a realistic threat scenario where an attacker attempts to extract:
• Running services
• Operating system details
• Known vulnerabilities
• Weak configurations
FortiGate actively monitors such reconnaissance attempts and triggers IPS events when 
signatures match malicious patterns.
5.3 Log & Report — IPS Detection
FortiGate’s IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) successfully detected the Nmap-generated 
attack patterns and logged them under:
Log & Report → Security Events → Intrusion Prevention
Key observations from the IPS logs:
✔ Attack Source
• 192.168.20.10 (Attacker VM / Kali Linux)
✔ Attack Target
• 192.168.10.10 (Admin VM)
✔ Severity Level
• High (based on FortiGuard threat score)
✔ Detected Threat Example
• Attack Name: Adobe.XML.Entity.Injection
• Attack ID: 18162
• Direction: Outgoing (from attacker subnet to admin subnet)
• Action: Dropped or Detected depending on policy configuration
• Profile Used: IPS-Strict
✔ IPS Response
The IPS engine recognized malicious scanning signatures triggered by Nmap’s vulnerability 
scripts.
Examples of matched patterns include:
• XML Injection patterns
• Suspicious HTTP probing
• Service enumeration attempts
• SMB probing attempts
The IPS logs provide detailed metadata:
• Time of attack
• Threat severity score
• Signature ID
• URL reference to the FortiGuard database
• Full packet inspection outcome
Security Significance
These logs confirm that:
• The firewall successfully identified the attacker’s reconnaissance activity.
• IPS signatures matched the scanning behavior.
• Policies blocked or monitored suspicious packets based on configured security 
profiles.
• Administrators can trace each suspicious packet with forensic-level detail
